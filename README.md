This project is a final project in my bachealor studies and its done in a team of 3 people - my collagues Momir Carevic and Dejan Pejic
Hough module is a part of a Hough Transformation system that is accelerated here in hardware. The role of a module is to detect the straight lines on an input image and draw the out 
on an output one. 

I specifed in Functional verification here and developed an UVM testbench.

Here is a **FULL** project development flow with following steps : 
1) System level design - Started from the inital idea and algorithm
2) RTL system design - Created a vision and a sketch of a design along with some optimizations
3) Functional verification - Created a UVM testbench that proves a valid behavior of a design.
4) Driver and application development for a design.
